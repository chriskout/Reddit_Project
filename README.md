If something looks weird, at its from pre-existing data, that is just from data reformatting and you will (hopefully) not have the same problem. 
I likely just missed deleting it.

Can we talk about how bad OAuth is on angular. Doing normal Oauth was fine, like 30 lines of code and I only had to create one service. But getting Oauth
to take you to a page right after you log in is the worst!!! Its like 300 lines of code, I had to create an extra service, a model, and a resolver, and
had to do a crazy promise chain. The worst part is there are so many angular Oauth guides, and none of them talk about getting the user to a new page.
You know, the actually hard part of oauth. Yeah lets not talk about it. This took me about as long as everything, I tried at least 5 different methods
and none of them worked except for one the earlier ones I tried when I retried it. 

ANYWAY...

There are still so many TODO's I have but I have to stop here for my sanity. Brief list
TODO:
1. Add authguard
2. Add global css (switch to scss)
3. Global website banner, with logout function attached
4. User page where they can view all their posts.
5. Get More posts/Comments buttons that let you look at older posts and comments
